# Medical Data Visualizer

This is my approach for the Medical Data Visualizer project with some help from the FreeCodeCamp forum. Please take my work as a reference not a solution.

The project objective is creating a graph that shows the counts of good and bad outcomes for the cholesterol, gluc, alco, active, and smoke variables for patients with cardio=1 and cardio=0 in different panels.
